# Klein


A small game where you have to depolluate the Klein's bottle

The Klein's bottle is a non-orientable surface. Move the small robot (Arrows left and right to turn and Arrow up to move). Spacebar to cross the surface.

The aim of the game is to collect the green polution particules. The aim of the project is to experience manifolds.
